# AJAX

## What it is ?

### MDN Definition:-

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is a programming practice of combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the DOM, and the XMLHttpRequest
object to build more complex webpages.What AJAX allows you to do is just update parts of a webpage instead of having to reload the entire
page.


### W3 schools

* Update a web page without reloading the page
* Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
* Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
* Send data to a server - in the background



## How to do ?

### XHR (XMLHttpRequest)

XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is a JavaScript API to create AJAX requests.

Use XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh.
This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.

* Create xhr object
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

* Prepare the request - open
xhr.open('get', 'http://example.com/users', true);

* Send reqeust. Request is dispatched to the server from here.
xhr.send(null)

* 'readyState' property to know the status of the ajax request.

0	UNSENT	open() not called yet.

1	OPENED	open() has been called.

2	SENT	send() has been called, but no response has been received yet.

3	LOADING	Downloading; responseText holds partial data.

4	DONE	The operation is complete. All response data is available

*/

xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
	if ( xhr.readyState == 4 ) {
		console.log(xhr.responseText);
	} else {
		console.log('request is not successfull ', xhr.status);
	}
}

* HEADERS
xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');
