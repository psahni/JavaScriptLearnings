""Typed""

- It takes abilities of both dynamic and typed languages
- Angular 2 is made in typescript
- It gives javascript a much more object oriented nature


Installation

- Install Node.js
- npm install g typescript

- create  a file hello.ts

- compile it
  > tsc hello.ts
  > node hello.js


- Type checking happens at the compile time

- Three types to declare 1. var 2. let 3. const

- Boolean, Number, String, Array, Tuple, Enum, Any, Void

// Array
- var ages : number[] = [22, 33, 11];

// Tuple
- let player: [number, string, number, number]
player = [3, 'Silver Pool', 333, 33]
- When we know the number of elements and their data type, then in that case Tuple should be used.

// Enum
enum ApprovalStatus {Approved, Pending, Rejected}
let job: ApprovalStatus = ApprovalStatus.pending;


// Any
var apiData : any[] = [123, 'Jordan', false]; // We are not sure what kind of data we will receive from api response

// Void
function printOut(msg: string) : void {
  console.log(mdg);
}
// The function will not return any thing. Just executes

- Type Aliases

type PlayerArray =  Array<string>
let players : PlayerArray = ["Prashant", "Ankur", "Anand"];
console.log(players);

- Union Data types

type PlayerArray =  Array<string | number>
let players : PlayerArray = ["Prashant", "Ankur", "Anand"];
let player_numbers : PlayerArray = ['2', '11', '21']
console.log(players);
console.log(player_numbers);

var names : string[]|string
names = ["Prashant", "Amit", "Sandy"];
names = "Akansha";


// Looping

// for in
// for of

let players : number[] = [2,3,4,5,6];

for (let player in players ) {
  console.log(players[player]) ; // Here player is an index
}

for (let player of players ) {
  console.log(player) ; // Here player is a value.
}

// while loop

// Functions

function gradeGen(grade: number) : string {
  return "asdf";
}

// The above function should return string.

gradeGen("A") // It wont let me call this function in typescript.


printAddress(address_line_1: string, address_line_2?: string, state = "Delhi") {
  console.log(address_line_1);
  if(address_line_2) {
    console.log(address_line_1);
  }
}
// In the above function, argument address_line_2 is made optional.
// state has a default value.

- We can not have a required value argument after the optional value argument. Mapping issues will happen.

* Rest Arguments

function createTeam(name: string, ...players: string[]) {

  for ( let player of players ) {
    console.log(player);
  }
}

* Arrow functions

var fullName = (first, last) => {
  return first + " " + last;
}

- arrow functions save the context of the function in which it is defined.
- It maintains the value of this.
- If you want a function to be called from calling context( you don't want to care about the function defining context), then we should not use arrow function.

- Function expression and declaration

function fullName(first: string, last: string) : string {
  return first + " " + last;
}

var otherName = (first: string, last: string) => string;
