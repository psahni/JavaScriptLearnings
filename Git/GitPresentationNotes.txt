* What is git
  Git is an open source, distributed version control system designed for speed and efficiency

  A tool that manages and tracks different versions of software or other content is referred
  to generically as a version control system (VCS),

    

		Git advantages:-
		- Facilitate distributed development
		- Scale to handle thousands of developers
		- Perform quickly and efficiently
		- Maintain integrity and trust
		- Immutability
		
  * ON DISTRIBUTED PHILOSHPHY


  There are generally two models in version control systems: centralized and
  distributed.Tools such as Subversion typically require a network connection
  to a centralized server.You make a change to your project and then commit
  that change, which is sent to the centralized server to track. Other developers
  can then immediately access your changes.

  Distributed version control systems, such as Git, break the process of committing
  code and sharing it with others into two parts.You can commit your
  code to your local private repository without having to talk to a centralized
  server, removing the need to be connected to a network to make a change.

  * Facilitate Distributed Development

  There are many facets to “distributed development,” and Linus wanted a new VCS
  that would cover most of them. It had to allow parallel as well as independent and
  simultaneous development in private repositories without the need for constant
  synchronization with a central repository, which could form a development bottleneck.
  It had to allow multiple developers in multiple locations even if some of them were offline temporarily.
  
  - Developer can work independently and synchronize their code with the central repositoty, 
  share their code with other devs whenever they want to.
  - Thousands of developers at multiple locations can work on their own machine without even being connected to network.
  - Network latency does not hinder daily development

  WHY ?
  - You want to record and manage the changes. You want to see the diff between the two revisions and switch to the change if some thing goes
  wrong in your current revision.
  - You want to keep the track/see of the history of the changes/modifications. What changes has been made and who made changes at what time. Specially when 
  you are working in a Team env.
  - You want to have backup of each of your revision.
