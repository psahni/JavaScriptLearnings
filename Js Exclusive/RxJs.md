- reactivex api implementation
- async programming. A program that does something and wait for something to happen and then react to it.

- We wait for the response to come from the server and do something. So something will happen in the future.
- Some event will occur in the future and we need some code that will handle that event.


- Observable streams



- Programming paradigm that works with Asynchronous data streams.

* STREAM
- A stream is a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time.

* OBSERVABLES 
- Observables are used to watch these streams and emit functions when value, error or complete signal is returned.
- Observables can be subscribed to by an observer.

* REACTIVE EXTENSIONS/ ReactiveX
- This is a library

* Observable from events
