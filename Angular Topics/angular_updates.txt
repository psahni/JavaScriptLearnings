Angular 2 shows a substantial change in the structure as compared to version 1.0. The architecture of AngularJS is based on MVC 
whereas the architecture of Angular 2 is based on service/controller. 

There is very less possibility to upgrade the Angular 1 to 2, mainly developers have to rewrite the entire application code.


Upgrade of the version from 2.0 to 4.0 has reduced it’s bundled file size by 60%. The code generated is reduced and has accelerated the 
application development. Here the developed code can be used for prod mode and debug.

The controller concept which was present in Angular v1.0 is eliminated in Angular v2.0. Angular v2.0 has changed to component based UI. 
This helps a developer to divide the applications in terms of components with desired features and enable to call required UI. These 
have helped to improve the flexibility and reusability as compared to Angular v1.0


Angular 6

Angular Elements will give us the ability to use our Angular components in other environments (like a simple jQuery app or VueJS app). 
It will take an Angular component and wrap it inside a Custom Element (aka DOM element), allowing us to use our sweet sweet Angular 
components in other projects that don’t have the full Angular ecosystem!

This will be the third rendering engine Angular has seen. The second was between version 2 and 4, called the View Engine. After they 
replaced it the first time, they saw increases in speed and decreases in application size, while having almost no reports of 
incompatibilities. They are hoping to see the same kind of results this time as well.
