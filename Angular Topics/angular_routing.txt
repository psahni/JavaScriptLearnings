import {Routes, RouterModule} from "@angular/router";

const routes: Routes = [
{ path: '', component: HomeComponent },
{ path: 'search', component: SearchComponent }
];


We need to add a directive called router-outlet somewhere in our template HTML. This directive
tells Angular where it should insert each of those components in the route, we’ll add ours to the
AppComponent, like so:

<app-header></app-header>
<div class="m-t-1">
<router-outlet></router-outlet> ①
</div>

{path: '**', component: HomeComponent} 

if the URL doesn’t match any of the otherroutes it will match this route

RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {useHash: true})
