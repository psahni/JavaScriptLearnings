SYNTAX PARSERS

A PROGRAM THAT 
- READS YOUR CODE 
- DETERMINES WHAT IT DOES 
- IF ITS GRAMMER IS VALID

LEXICAL ENVIRONEMENT

WHERE SOMETHING SITS PHYSICALLY IN THE CODE YOU WRITE

* A lexical env exists in programming languages in which where you write something is important.

```
function () {
    var a  = 10;
}

```

In the above example, the variable sits inside the function.

What surrounds a particular code and where it is written.

EXECUTION CONTEXT

* There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currrently running is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what you have written in your code.

* A function is executed in execution context.

* The running code + some more code

CONCEPTUAL ASIDE

NAME/VALUE PAIR

THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL OBJECT.


Open the dev console
JS file is loaded
Syntax parser is started
Nothing to parse
But it created a execution context. The global object is window object. - this

When variables and functions are not inside the function, then they gets attached to window.
