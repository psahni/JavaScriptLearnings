# Installation

npm install --save-dev webpack@2.2.0-rc.0


- entry
- output
- path module
- __dirname : It is a reference to current working directory.
It is a constant in node.js

- npm run build: It will pick the webpack from your node_modules and run it otherwise if you run it
directly it will pick from globally installed modules


Good to read. configuration settings mentioned.

# TOPICS COVERED IN UDEMY PRESENTATION:-
- Server Side Templating and single page App.
- Server Side Templating and single page App flow.
- Spoke about the popularity of SPA.
- Amount of js code execute is huge on the browser compared to sst. This is the modern web trend.
- Why type of problems arise when we have huge code of javascript ?

# S2L4
- main.js   util.js   home.js
- Working on large code bases is a challenge. Finding the code..
- Distribution of code to multiple files makes code easy to locate.
- So the idea of modules is born.
- So we have many small files.
- Components Folder and API folder -- separation of code. (Section 2 Lecture 4)
- But still there can be challenges. Splitting of files(Modules).
- Splitting of files into many files is not the complete solution either.

# S2L5

- Load order  :  Order os files loaded should be distict whenver app starts.
- Performance : Having many files loaded is a bad idea from performance stand point.

- This is exacly how the webpack plays its role.
- Webpack takes bigger pile of javascripts code and merge them together into one bundle.js

# S2L6
- Start work on the demo app. npm init generates a new project.
- package.json contains project depedencies.

# S2L7
- How index.js will have access to sum.js. We have to form some link between them.
- Common Js(Impletemented by Node.js ), ES 2015: These are module systems.

# S2L8
- Explain about linking two files index.js and sum.js

# S2L9
- Install Webpack.

$ npm install --save-dev webpack@2.2.0-rc.0 - Install it as a project dependency.

- Sum.js + index.js  => Webpack => bundle.js

- webpack.config.js: When we run webpack, it will look automatically this file.

- There must be two pieces of information to b provided in order to run webpack.
  config = { }

- index.js <- sum.js ( index.js depends upon sum.js. index.js runs our app. It is the entry point our application)
- This file only imports all things, does not exports any thing.

# S2L10
  - output property of config is an object.
  - The 'entry' of config is a relative path, but 'output' must be a absolute path. Its a
  directory where our bundle.js will be saved.
  - path.resolve(__dirname, 'build') :- build directory inside current working directory.

# S2L11
  - webpack command will try to find the webpack from globally installed node modules
  - 'npm run build' will pick webpack from projects's node_modules

 # S2L12
  - When we run this command, we find that two files sum.js and index.js are of few bytes(180 and 12) but bundle.js is 3KB
  which is quite large as compared to sum of these two files. So it must be generating some code as well.

  - If we analyse bundle.js, we find that what webpack does, it takes all modules code and stuffs it into individual functions
  and stuff those individual functions into an array.
  - So, no magic is involved.

# S2L13
  - How to load bundle.js ?
    We need to have single html file, whose purpose only have to load bundle.js

  - Open the index.html in the browser, that should output the sum in the console.
  - If you are doing any changes in the js. Then run again :- 'npm run build' or just 'webpack'

# S2L14
Webpack core purpose is to combine multiple js modules into one bundle.js file.


# Setting up babel:-

Three main packages
- babel-loader
- babel-core
- babel-preset-env

$ npm install -g babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-env

# S2L15

* Loader system in webpack

# S2L16 Babel configuration

We want to use babel only for javascript files.
babel-preset: what are we going to do with files that are loaded.

# S2L17

module.exports = sum; -> common js module sys
export default sum;  -> es2015 module sys.

# S2L18 Handling css with Webpack
- To have any file in bundle.js. We have to import the file somewhere
import './image_viewer'

# S2L19 CSS loaders - Importing a css file
import '../styles/image_viewer.css' - This statement is written inside image_viewer.js

We have add loaders. CSS loader and Style loader.
css-loader: just imports the file.
style-loader: takes the imported file and add its it to the html document.

# S2L20 Loaders are tricky
Javascript is actually adding the css into the head portion of the html document.
Normally we expect that bunch of css files are concatened into one css, but it is not the case here.

Wepack writes some generated code into bundle.js, which actually applies the css to the html.

# S3L21 The Extract Text Plugin
Loading css separately is a better idea than adding it through js.
There is diff better plugin and a loader. Plugins ensures that the generated file is not included into the bundle.js
